This is an unofficial API for the Nexecur system, forked from a deleted repository originally created by Baudev. This fork for HomeAssistant is maintained by Loule95450.

You can now install and use this API as a Home Assistant integration via HACS.

What you get:

- An Alarm control panel entity that shows the current state (armed/disarmed)
- Actions to arm and disarm the alarm from Home Assistant
- Camera entities for viewing RTSP streams from Nexecur cameras
- Automatic polling of the panel status and camera streams (every 30 seconds by default)
- Dynamic discovery of new cameras when they are added to your system

Installation (via HACS):

1. In HACS, add this repository as a Custom Repository (category: Integration).
2. Install the "Nexecur" integration.
3. Restart Home Assistant.
4. Go to Settings > Devices & Services > Add Integration > search for "Nexecur".
5. Enter your credentials:
   - id_site (wiring code)
   - password (PIN). Note: it is used to derive the secure hashes required by Nexecur.
   - deviceName (optional, used to register this instance with Nexecur; defaults to "Home Assistant").

Entity: after setup, you should see:
- An alarm entity like `alarm_control_panel.nexecur_alarm` to arm/disarm the system
- Camera entities like `camera.nexecur_camera_{site_id}_{serial}` for each discovered camera with streaming capability

Camera Features:
- RTSP streams are automatically refreshed every 30 seconds to maintain connection
- New cameras are automatically discovered when added to your Nexecur system
- Camera entities show as unavailable when the stream is not accessible
- Stream URLs are provided to Home Assistant's camera platform for viewing

Troubleshooting:

- If login fails, doubleâ€‘check id_site and your PIN. The integration derives cryptographic hashes based on the server-provided salt.
- The integration talks to the official Nexecur endpoints used by the mobile app. If Nexecur changes those endpoints, the integration may need an update.
- If cameras are not discovered, ensure your Nexecur system has streaming enabled and that cameras are properly configured.
- Camera streams may take up to 30 seconds to appear after being added to the system due to the polling interval.
