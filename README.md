This is an unofficial API for the Nexecur system, forked from a deleted repository originally created by Baudev. This fork for HomeAssistant is maintained by Loule95450.

You can now install and use this API as a Home Assistant integration via HACS.

What you get:

- An Alarm control panel entity that shows the current state (armed/disarmed)
- Actions to arm and disarm the alarm from Home Assistant
- Automatic polling of the panel status (every 30 seconds by default)

Installation (via HACS):

1. In HACS, add this repository as a Custom Repository (category: Integration).
2. Install the "Nexecur" integration.
3. Restart Home Assistant.
4. Go to Settings > Devices & Services > Add Integration > search for "Nexecur".
5. Enter your credentials:
   - id_site (wiring code)
   - password (PIN). Note: it is used to derive the secure hashes required by Nexecur.
   - deviceName (optional, used to register this instance with Nexecur; defaults to "Home Assistant").

Entity: after setup, you should see an alarm entity like alarm_control_panel.nexecur_alarm. Use it to arm/disarm.

Troubleshooting:

- If login fails, doubleâ€‘check id_site and your PIN. The integration derives cryptographic hashes based on the server-provided salt.
- The integration talks to the official Nexecur endpoints used by the mobile app. If Nexecur changes those endpoints, the integration may need an update.
