This is an unofficial API for the Nexecur system, forked from a deleted repository originally created by Baudev. This fork for HomeAssistant is maintained by Loule95450.

You can now install and use this API as a Home Assistant integration via HACS.

What you get:

- An Alarm control panel entity that shows the current state (armed/disarmed)
- Actions to arm and disarm the alarm from Home Assistant
- Camera stream switch entities to control when camera streams are activated ("Allumer [Camera Name]")
- Camera entities for viewing RTSP streams from Nexecur cameras (when switches are active)
- Automatic polling of the panel status (every 30 seconds by default)
- Dynamic discovery of new cameras when they are added to your system

Installation (via HACS):

1. In HACS, add this repository as a Custom Repository (category: Integration).
2. Install the "Nexecur" integration.
3. Restart Home Assistant.
4. Go to Settings > Devices & Services > Add Integration > search for "Nexecur".
5. Enter your credentials:
   - id_site (wiring code)
   - password (PIN). Note: it is used to derive the secure hashes required by Nexecur.
   - deviceName (optional, used to register this instance with Nexecur; defaults to "Home Assistant").

Entity: after setup, you should see:
- An alarm entity like `alarm_control_panel.nexecur_alarm` to arm/disarm the system
- Switch entities like `switch.allumer_{camera_name}` to control camera stream activation
- Camera entities like `camera.nexecur_camera_{site_id}_{serial}` for each camera (when streams are active)

Camera Features:
- Camera streams are controlled by switch entities named "Allumer [Camera Name]"
- Activating a switch requests an RTSP stream from the Nexecur API for that camera
- Switches automatically turn off after 30 seconds (matching API limitations)
- Camera entities only appear and show streams when their corresponding switches are active
- This prevents automatic stream requests that could trigger camera lights unnecessarily
- New cameras are automatically discovered when added to your Nexecur system

Troubleshooting:

- If login fails, doubleâ€‘check id_site and your PIN. The integration derives cryptographic hashes based on the server-provided salt.
- The integration talks to the official Nexecur endpoints used by the mobile app. If Nexecur changes those endpoints, the integration may need an update.
- If camera switches are not discovered, ensure your Nexecur system has cameras configured and accessible.
- Camera streams only appear when you manually activate the corresponding switch.
- If a camera switch doesn't work, the camera may not support streaming or may be offline.
- Remember that camera switches automatically turn off after 30 seconds to comply with API limitations.
